## Overview

This website is a redesign of the website (https://www.contour556.com.au/). The website was redesigned and several changes were made to provide a better user experience in terms of form and content, as well as making the site more compatible with mobile and tablet devices, and bringing life to the site by making the content more interactive in terms of design.

## User Interface

To make the user interface more friendly, the number of items in the Navigation has been reduced from 8 to 4 in order to not distract the user and make them more focused on the most important information. The navigation has also been made interactive with the user so that a line with growing animation appears under the word that is hovered with the mouse pointer.
Two links to two pages have been placed in the footer because they are less important than others, and they have been indicated with useful links.

## Compatibility with mobile and tablet devices

The original site is compatible with mobile devices and tablets, but some elements and images were not compatible with the best possible way with mobile devices.

At first, the Navigation was modified to be compatible with mobile devices, where the horizontal menu was replaced with the hamburger menu, which when pressed shows the new information.

The way the images are displayed has been modified to adapt and benefit from the width of the tablet and mobile screens and use the screen sizes in more efficient way.

The way most texts appear has been modified to center the screen when using the mobile phone, which makes it easier to read the content and shows it in a better way.

On the Donate and Support page, the form has been made compatible with different screen types.

## Artists Gallery

The Artists Gallery has been developed to be designed in the form of cards. These cards are fully responsive to the screen size (and device type) and interactive. When hovering the card with the mouse pointer, the color of the board changes.

## Things that can be improved

In the version that I developed, there are many things that I wanted to add or improve, but this was not done either due to programming difficulties or the tight time frame for delivering the project.

1. On the page 2016, 2018 and 2020, I wanted to add a feature so that when I click on an artist's card, a pop-up appears showing the rest of his work in the form of a slide show.
2. On the same pages that were mentioned in the first point, I wanted to add a way to sort artists according to their works, the category they were directed to, or other categories.
3. I wanted to add a search feature to the website in order to facilitate the search for information or a specific artist.
4. I wanted to make the website more compatible with the user by adding animations that make browsing the website more fun and attractive, especially for teenagers and young adults.
5. I wanted to make the website provide more personalized content for mobile devices and tablets.
